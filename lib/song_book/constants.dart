Thus my dear Redeemer meet?
Not one day of service give Him,
Lay no trophy at His feet?

Must I go - and empty - handed?
Must  I meet my Saviour so?
Not one soul with which to greet Him:
Must I empty-handed go?

2.Not at death I shrink or falter,
For my Saviour saves me now;
But to meet Him empty-handed,
Thought of that now clouds my brow.

3.Oh, the years of sinning wasted,
Could I but recall them now,
I would give them to my Saviour
To His will I’d gladly bow.

4.Up,ye saints, arouse, be earnest!
Up, and work while yet ‘tis day:
Ere the night of death o’ertake you:
Strive for souls while yet you may.\n\n\n''';
